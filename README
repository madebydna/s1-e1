-- RMU SESSION #1 | PROBLEM 1
-- Submissions due 20:00 UTC 2010.09.07

If in doubt about how to submit, see SUBMISSION_GUIDELINES file.

For exercise #1, you'll be doing a bit of web service integration.  Your goal
will be to create some interesting mashup by connecting any web service of your
choosing to twitter, either by creating an automated feed from an external
data source, or a bot which responds in an interesting way to certain kinds
of tweets.

## Thesaurus Twitter Bot

http://twitter.com/twisaurus

This twitter bot consumes the Wordnik API in order to reply with a list of synonyms when prompted by a private messages.
These are the directions to see it in action:

1. Start following http://twitter.com/twisaurus
2. The bot will start following you and send a greeting that explains how Twisaurus works.
3. Send a private message in the format word [modifier, e.g. noun, verb, adjective, adverb]
4. You should receive a reply with the list of synonyms.

## Notes about my submission

- The Wordnik API does not alway work as advertised. For example a nonsense string should elicit a certain JSON structure that clearly indicates that the word was not found. This should be different from the case when no synonyms were found for a word. In reality both cases return an empty array.
- The synonyms returned are often not synonyms of the word at all, but only something vaguely related.
- The API indicates that filtering by word types is possible (noun, verb, adjective, adverb), but that also doesn't seem to work as supposed to.
